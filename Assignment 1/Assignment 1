HTML Tutorial Notes:

“Introduction to HTML” - 00 
Hyper Text Markup Language - HTML
Document that contains text 
Web browsers read & display documents that contain HTML
< > - angle brackets contain tag 
<body> something inside here </body> 
Start tag with only bracket, end tag with slash 
Together they form a markup element ; a set of tags with something inside them 
<BR> - this is a line break
Empty element  because it does not contain anything and therefore doesn't need a closed tag 

“Creating the First Web Page” - 01
Step One: doctype declaration 
1st step: use doctype declaration to tell the browser what type of document to open
Use <!doctype html> to make a doctype declaration for html
Step Two: Html element 
Use html to make a markup element 
Ie. <html> </html>
Everything in the document will go between these two html tags
Step Three: Head Section
Need head element 
Ie. <head> </head>
This section contains the title, but can also be used to identify the language of the page (such as english, Spanish, etc.) 
Step Four: Title Element 
The title element will show up on the title page of the web browser 
Embed the title element in the head element 
Ie. <title> my webpage </title>
Step Five: Body Element 
The body element holds the content of the web page & is the primary section of web page  
Ie. <body> </body>
Step Six: Put Content in Body Element
Heading 
Ie. <h1> title </h1>
Will create larger title for the website section 
Paragraph 
Ie. <p1> everything about me is in this website </h1>
Creates a paragraph for text 
Second Heading
Ie. <h2> my hobbies are reading and writing </h2> 
Creates a title for the non-primary section (with a smaller text) 
Step Seven: Save Code on Desktop (Save As)
Name file 
Then minimize code & click on the file to view 

“Lines Breaks, Comments, & Spacing ” - 02
Line Breaks
Use <br> for line breaks 
Comments 
Use (Ie.  <!-- this is the start of the html code for the second section and we will start each section with a header tag --> to include internal comments for code
The code won’t show up on the website     
Need explanation point to make sure it doesn't show up as text 
Spacing 
Use &nbsp to add additional spaces; can add as many as needed/wanted 
Main Elements (from free code camp)
<main> paragraphs nested inside </main>
